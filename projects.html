                <h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, we successfully designed and implemented a backtracking algorithm using <br>a DFS â€“
                    Tree Graph Traversing approach to solve Sudoku puzzles. Our algorithm accurately <br>solved Sudoku
                    puzzles of varying complexity levels, ranging from easy to hard, within a<br> reasonable time frame.
                    The
                    user-friendly interface we developed allowed users to input and <br>solve Sudoku puzzles with ease,
                    enhancing the usability of our algorithm.
                    <br><br>

                    Our project contributes to the field of Sudoku puzzle solving by providing an efficient and
                    <br>accurate
                    backtracking algorithm that can be used for solving Sudoku puzzles. The user-friendly <br>interface
                    adds
                    value to our algorithm, making it accessible and convenient for users to interact with.<br>However,
                    there are still opportunities for further research and improvement. Other algorithms
                    and<br>approaches, such as constraint propagation or logic-based techniques, can be explored and
                    compared<br>to our backtracking algorithm to determine their effectiveness in solving Sudoku
                    puzzles.
                    <br><br>

                    Our project successfully developed a backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles, and the<br>
                    user-friendly interface we developed enhances its usability. Our results demonstrate the
                    accuracy<br>and efficiency of our algorithm, and our project serves as a foundation for future
                    research
                    and<br>improvements in Sudoku puzzle solving algorithms.
